Description: # decaychain
        This package decays single or multiple radionuclides and computes the daughter radionuclides and their concentrations at a user defined time.
        
        
        
        Currently this package has only been tested on Python 3.6 running on Linux OS.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ```console
        $ pip install decaychain
        ```
        
        Syntax for Use
        --------------
        
        Syntax for input is as follows:
        
        ```console
        >>> from decaychain import bateman_multi
        >>> bateman_multi({"U-238":1e7, "235U":1e7}, 3e9, "yr", "Bq")
        ```
        
        This decays both U-238 and U-235 at a concentration of 1e7 Bq for 3e9 years.
        
        The Pint module(https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.12/)  is used to handle time units so a variety of time units can be used.
        
        The nuclide input is tolerant of a variety of radionuclide formats.
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        radioactivedecay uses decay data from ICRP Publication 107 (2008) combined with a Bateman Decay solution to calculate the final concentrations of nuclides

        Limitations
        -----------
        
        The following processes are not modelled by radioactivedecay:
        - ingrowth of progeny from spontaneous fission decays
        - neutronics, so no modelling of induced radioactivity or fission
